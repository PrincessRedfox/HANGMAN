# HANGMAN
A games publisher has approached your company and requested the development of a number of games to be delivered in episodes through their website. These games are aimed at schoolchildren and are designed to be an aid to spelling, and grammar. You have been asked to work on the first episode of the game which is a modern take on the game of Hangman.

The aim of the game is to guess a word, for every letter that is guessed correctly that letter will be revealed in the correct position in the word. If a letter is not in the word then a part of the hangman will become visible and the player will lose a life.
If the hangman becomes completely visible before they have guessed the word then the player loses, if they unveil the whole word before the hangman is completed then the player wins.

The publisher has sent you some requirements:

- The game and word content must be appropriate for students of upper primary school age (8-10)
- An alternative to the traditional hangman should be considered.
-	The game is for a single player only.
-	The player must be informed whether they have won or not.
-	Each time a letter has been chosen, you should not be able to choose it again.
-	The player should get no more than 10 chances to guess the word correctly.
